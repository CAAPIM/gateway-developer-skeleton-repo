# About
This is a skeleton repository that you can use as a starting point for your gateway projects. For simplicity, this repository assumes your Gateway solution uses a **single module**. 

To make use of the Gateway Policy Plugin, your Gateway project should be structured like a typical Gradle project like the one shown here, which requires two configuration files - build.gradle and settings.gradle. 

Learn how to set up your single-module Gateway solution by following the [instructions.](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/layer7-api-management/gateway-policy-plugin/1-0.html)

For information about API Gateway Policy Plugin, see [TechDocs.](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/ca-enterprise-software/layer7-api-management/gateway-policy-plugin/1-0.html)
